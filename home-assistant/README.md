## Goal
Centralize home automation with dashboards, notifications, and sensor-driven automations.

## Tools Used
- Home Assistant
- Sensor ecosystem (e.g., door/contact, temperature, vibration, leak)
- Cameras (optional)
- Voice assistant (optional)

## Setup (Summary)
1. Install Home Assistant (container or dedicated device).
2. Integrate sensors via native integrations or local hubs.
3. Build a wall-mounted dashboard (tablet or spare display).
4. Add presence/alerts, leak detection notifications, and camera views.

## Outcome
Unified control of sensors, lighting, and automations with a privacy-first local implementation.

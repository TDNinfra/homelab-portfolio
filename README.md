# IT & Homelab Projects Portfolio

This repository documents real-world projects implemented in a personal homelab.  
It intentionally avoids personal identifiers (names, exact locations, domains, IPs, API keys).

## Projects
- [Docker Stack Overview](./docker-stack/README.md)
- [Cloudflare + RTMP Secure Streaming](./cloudflare-rtmp/README.md)
- [Immich (Self-Hosted Photos)](./immich-setup/README.md)
- [Backblaze B2 NAS Backup](./backblaze-nas-backup/README.md)
- [Home Assistant + Smart Devices](./home-assistant/README.md)
- [Plex Media & Automation Suite](./plex-automation/README.md)
- [Vaultwarden (Password Manager)](./vaultwarden/README.md)

## Privacy & Security
- Redact hostnames, domains, IP addresses, tokens, and keys.
- Remove EXIF from screenshots; blur sensitive UI details.
- Avoid sharing logs with timestamps/identifiers.
- Rotate any credentials used during testing.
